TEST2 README

Iterative simultation of multiple flood bluetooth polling of different devices (not paired with the polling machine). The number of multiple bluetooth polling is defined by the user

Required script:
	- Test2.py (main program)
	- L2ping.py (l2ping execution and data (max/min/avg and number osent packet) recovering
	- Folder.py (creation of folder)
	- mathmath.py (computation of max/min/avg)
	- ErrorCounter.py (packet loss)

main program: Test2.py (python3 Test2.py)

Output: 	
	- Running time collection file
	- Packet loss collection file

Further analysis:

	- Counting Packets: number of succesfully transferred packets during the script run
		- CountingPackets.py (main program)

	- Mean RTT: RTT average after the multiple polling precesses are stopped
		- MEAN.py (main program)
